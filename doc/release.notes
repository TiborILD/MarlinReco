    GE.
    - Analysis/CLICPfoSelector: corrected logic to stop ihit90 index becoming negative.

 --------
| v01-02 |
 --------

    - new package Analysis/IsolatedLeptonFinderProcessor
      (R. Yonamine, KEK, T. Tanabe, U.Tokiyo)
    - TrackDigi/FPCCDDigi/src/FPCCDDigitizer: bug fixed - unified the layer number in each function.
    - TrackDigi/TPCDigi/src/TPCDigiProcessor: use lcio::ILDDetID::barrel instead of 0
    - made compatible w/ clang++ compiler


 -----------
| v01-01-01 |
 -----------

    - bug fixes in Analysis/RecoMCTruthLink/src/RecoMCTruthLinker.cc:

        - The LCRelation Collections for TrackerHit to SimTrackerHits have been merged into a list of collections. Internally a single collection of LCRelations is created.
        - create track and cluster relations in any case as they are needed for the final recomctruth-link
        - converted exit to exception


 --------
| v01-01 |
 --------
      
      - RecoMCTruthLinker
        -  added mcTruthTrackLink: inverse relation from MCParticles to Tracks
           the weight will be the fraction of all sim-hits from the MCParticle
           that contributed to this track
        - changed weight definition for trackMCTruthLink:
          - weight is the fraction of all hits on the the track that have 
            contributions from this MCParticle
          - computed as sumSimHits_from_this_MCParticle/total_number_of_hits_on_track
             -> weight can be large than 1.0 (if more than one hit from an MCParticle
                would be used in a given layer (delta ray))
             -> this definition of weights is more accurate for defining the 'fake hit rate'
                as (1.-weight) in the case of many merged sim hits for a given track
         - changed steering logic, such that it can be more easily called for
           certain sub-tasks, eg. Track-MCTruth-Link only:
         - made the following output collections optional:
           trackMCTruthLink, clusterMCTruthLink, RecoMCTruthLink, calo-hit MCTruthLink, skimmed MCParticle
           -> collections won't be created if empty name specified (default)
         - removed options:
           OutputClusterRelation, OutputCalohitRelation, OutputTrackRelation
           they are now also based on name empty/not empty 
         - changed default for UseTrackerHitRelations to 'true'
            - print WARNING of set to false
           -- F.Gaede

      - LDCCaloDigi
          Implement use of LCIO calorimeter Hit step position for SDHCAL digitizer 
          (multiplicity simulation) and add parameters to the processor to better 
          control the digitization -- Gerald Grenier IPNL

      - TPCDigi
          Bug fix: added smearing of merged TPC hits
          (using rather large errors - which may have to be iterated on.)

	- VTXDigiProcessor: corrected smearing to be along ladder, previously it was incorrectly perpendicular to the ladder, 
                            due to the use of the ladders phi angle instead of it angle of inclination

	- FPCCDDigitizer: Fixed bug in helix approximation.- in previous version the intersection between particle and ladder 
                          could be rotated to the opposite side.

        - RecoMCTruthLinker: Bug fix: protect against undefined mother pointer (T.Tanabe )
	  		     Modified to be able to use TrackerHit relations, though not yet the default. 
			     Enable by setting UseTrackerHitRelations true in steering file

	- TPCDigiProcessor: Corrected problem where hits from alternative z halves could be considered to be adjacent
	  		    Removed SimHits from RawHits and Used Relations. The deprecated feature to store them in the 
			    rawhits can be enabled by setting UseRawHitsToStoreSimhitPointer true.

       - modified TPC digitization for new TPC driver (S.Aplin)
       - removed silicon tracking from BrahmsTracking

       - new package MarlinKinFit (J.List)
	 * Analysis/MarlinKinfit
         * kinematic fits with constraints
         * see doxygen documentation       

       - improved TrackBasedPFlow (O.Wendt)
	 * example steering file for the
	   Track-Based Particle Flow processor
	 * bug fixes and improved performance
         * LEPTracking: use TrackerHit::getCovMatrix for resolution

       - make consistent use of GEAR (K.Harder, C.Lynch) 
         * TrackDigi/VTXDigi: introduce gear
         * use global GEAR B field setting instead of TPC parameters setting in:
           Analysis/CheckPlots, Pflow/TrackBasedPFlow, Pflow/Wolf, Tracking/BrahmsTracking
         * updated example gear files (Bfield)
	 * Tracking/SiliconTracking: adjustments for new
	   GEAR file format as of Mokka v06-04-p02

       - improved FullLDCTracking (A.Raspereza)
         * some bugs fixed, e.g. wrong reference point
         * detailed users manual: doc/FullLDCTracking_Manual.pdf
         * consistent use of gear::BField 
       	 * TrackDigi/TPCDigi: Modified class for digitization of the
	   TPC hits. Spatial resolutions as well as parameters tpcPixRP and
	   tpcPixZ, representing the physical pad width and time binning
	   respectively, are passed to the processor as external parameters
	   (implemented by Clare Lynch)
         * example steering file
         * introduced various fit options
         * improved performance
         * digitization of laddered VXD detectors
  
       - improved code and cmake build files (J.Engels)
         * removed unused variables (compiler warnings)
         * install target for header files
         * fortran compiler flags and libg2c
            
       - improved documentation (F.Gaede)
	 * automatic generation of API doc (doxygen)


    -> see ChangeLog for details 

 --------
| v00-04 |
 --------
   - cmake is now default build tool:  (J.Engels)
        # edit BuildSetup.cmake as needed
        mkdir build ; cd build
        cmake -C ../BuildSetup.cmake ..
        make install
     -> creates plugin library $MarlinReco/lib/libMarlinReco.so
       

   - improved Tracking  (A.Raspereza)
       Extended version of TrackCheater, FullLDCTracking and SiliconTracking.
       The numbers of hits from different subdetectors are stored using
       TRACK:subdetectorHitNumbers. trackfit.F has been modified to
       account for curling tracks.

   -  Clustering/PhotonFinderKit/EMShowerFinder  (O.Wendt)
	  Processor to find electro-magnetic showers. 
          It is based on the KIT package and takes
	  only ECAL hits into account.	The output is a collection of
	  clusters in which the electro-magnetic shower are stored

   - TrackBasedPFlow (O.Wendt)
       + debugging and improvement of performance
       + included EMShowerFinder for improved efficiency to find
	 electromagnetic showers

   - bug fixes
       + made compliant with SL4 (gcc3.4) 
       +...

    -> see ChangeLog for details 

 --------
| v00-03 |
 --------
  - improved Full Tracking  (A.Raspereza)

  - initial version of TrackBasedPFA (O.Wendt)

  - PhotonFinderKit (P. Krstonosic)

  - added cmake support (epxerimental)
